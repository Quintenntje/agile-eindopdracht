# Grote prompts moeten voor deze opdracht opgelijst worden steek ze hierin.



Based on @idea.md @.antigravity make a good looking navigation for the users make sure you follow the antigravity rule guide, but start of by making a text component that will always be used and make sure that is dark/light mode supported to avoid having to add that feature to each text, once that Is made do the nav, for the nav use lucide icons to support each tab and also I want a big + button the the middle of the navigation, for the pages just put the title so I can test that the navigation actually works.

Make me a login and register page, make input and button component for this, Make sure the input can hold an errord that will the show the validation message. With firstname, lastname, email, password fields for register, and email and password for login.

Based on the login that you created make it functional by adding the created data to my supabase profiles, table and add the user to the auth, make the login then also functional after that.


Make sure the reports actually get send to the database, the image needs to be stored in supabase storage and the data in the recorded_trash table.

Make a good looking homepage that contains all the important information and usefull information for the user, read the rules, So it fits the design chooses and the idea.md so you know what we want to achieve.
