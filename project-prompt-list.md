Based on @idea.md @.antigravity make a good looking navigation for the users make sure you follow the antigravity rule guide, but start of by making a text component that will always be used and make sure that is dark/light mode supported to avoid having to add that feature to each text, once that Is made do the nav, for the nav use lucide icons to support each tab and also I want a big + button the the middle of the navigation, for the pages just put the title so I can test that the navigation actually works
